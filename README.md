Title: Exploring Global Gun-Related Deaths: A Data Analysis Journey

Introduction:
Gun violence is a pressing issue in many countries around the world. As a data analyst, I embarked on a journey to analyze and visualize the total number of gun-related deaths across different countries. Using Python libraries such as Matplotlib for visualization, Beautiful Soup for web scraping, and Pandas for data analysis, I aimed to shed light on the magnitude of this problem.

Data Collection:
To begin my analysis, I collected data on the total number of gun-related deaths from various countries. Using web scraping techniques with Beautiful Soup, I extracted the latest death statistics from reliable sources.

Data Analysis:
Once the data was collected, I used Pandas to analyze and process the information. I created a DataFrame with the country names and their corresponding total gun-related death counts, as shown in the table below:

|    Country   |  Total Deaths  |
|--------------|----------------|
|    Brazil    |     49437      |
| United States|     37040      |
|    Mexico    |     22118      |
|     India    |     14712      |
|   Colombia   |     13171      |
|   Venezuela  |     10599      |
| Philippines  |      9268      |
|  Guatemala   |      5982      |
|   Nigeria    |      5103      |
|     Iraq     |      4424      |

Data Visualization:
To gain insights into the global gun-related death toll, I utilized Matplotlib to create visually appealing graphs. Below is a bar graph illustrating the total number of gun-related deaths in the top 10 most affected countries:
